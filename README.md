# FNI-Pneumatic-Transfer-System
Small-scale pneumatic transfer system for irradiated samples of short-lived isotopes

This short-lived pneumatic transfer system allows experimenters and researchers to easily and conveniently irradiate samples of short-lived isotopes near the reactor core of the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor. Because the samples decay quickly, the timing of this application is critical, as the samples need to be counted very soon after they have been irradiated.

The system is controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 and takes inputs from two pushbuttons (to send and return samples) and a Photoelectric Amplifier (to home the rotary valve). Outputs include a solid-state relay for controlling the vacuum pump motor and the various controls associated with the stepper motor.
